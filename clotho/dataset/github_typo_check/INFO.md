## GitHub Typo Check Dataset (GH-TYPO)

This dataset is constructed based on the [GitHub-typo-corpus](https://github.com/mhagiwara/github-typo-corpus?tab=readme-ov-file) dataset, which contains real-world typo fixes collected from GitHub commits. We sampled 10000 one-line code changes from the original dataset for our experiments.
