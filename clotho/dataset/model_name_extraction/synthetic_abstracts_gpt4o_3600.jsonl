{"model_names": [["Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering Model"]], "abstract": "We introduce the Bayesian Hierarchical Clustering Model, a model that incorporates Bayesian inference into hierarchical clustering frameworks for enhanced uncertainty quantification. This approach provides probabilistic cluster assignments, improving the reliability of clustering outcomes in domains such as genomics and market segmentation. Our results show significant improvements in interpretability and robustness of clustering solutions with uncertainty assessments."}
